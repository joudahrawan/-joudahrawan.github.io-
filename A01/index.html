	<h2 align="center"> Career and Early Life </h2>
			<p> 
	Vincent van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, in Groot-Zundert, <br>Netherlands. Van Gogh was a post-impressionist painter whose work, <br>notable for its beauty, emotion and color, highly influenced 20th century art. <br> He struggled with mental illness, and remained poor <br>and virtually unknown throughout his life. Van Gogh died in <br>France on July 29, 1890, at age 37, from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

	<p> Van Gogh's art helped him stay emotionally <br>balanced. In 1885, he began work on what is considered to be<br> his first masterpiece, "Potato Eaters." His brother, <br>Theo, by this time living in Paris, believed the painting would not be <br>well-received in the French capital, where impressionism had become <br>the trend. Nevertheless, van Gogh decided to move to Paris,<br> and showed up at Theo's house uninvited. In March 1886,<br> Theo welcomed his brother into his small apartment.
